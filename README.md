# AGENTS.md Paradox Infographic

Single-page infographic that summarizes findings from _Evaluating AGENTS.md_ (arXiv:2602.11988v1), focused on how repository context files can reduce coding-agent task success while increasing inference cost.

## Original Source and Credit

This infographic is based on and credits the original paper:
**Evaluating AGENTS.md: Are Repository-Level Context Files Helpful for Coding Agents?**
by Thibaud Gloaguen, Niels Mundler, Mark Muller, Veselin Raychev, and Martin Vechev.

## Project Context

The entire `index.html` infographic was generated by Gemini 3.1 Pro. This is a key part of the project: the site exists both to communicate the paper's findings and to document a real-world AI-generated artifact built around those findings.

## What the infographic covers

- Comparison of baseline (no context) vs `AGENTS.md`-assisted task success
- Relative inference cost increase when context files are included
- Behavioral shifts (more traversal/testing and token usage)
- Common context-file anti-patterns and a lean checklist for better guidance

## Stack

- `index.html` (single-file page)
- Tailwind CSS (CDN)
- Chart.js (CDN)

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Deploy on Railway

This repo is configured for Railway with a minimal Node runtime:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Railway will set `PORT` automatically, and the site is served from the repo root (including `index.html`).
